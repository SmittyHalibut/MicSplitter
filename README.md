# MicSplitter
One Mic Enters, Several Mics Leave! Your "git clone" gets you the whole seat, BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE EDGE!!!

**ahem**  Sorry about that.

Ever have one headset with one mic that you really like, but several devices you want to connect it to?
Ever have it connected to one device and forget to connect it to the other device before you start
using it and don't realize until the end that you've been picking up all your room noise from the
built-in mic on your laptop?

Well, THIS IS THE PROJECT FOR YOU!
